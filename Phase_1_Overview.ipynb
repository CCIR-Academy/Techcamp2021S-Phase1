        "\n",
        "## Course Design\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals\n",
        "1. **Get familiar with the routine practices of programming**:\n",
        "  - How programmers connect to each other and work together (e.g. git repos, commit messages, issues, pull requests, discussions, social media)\n",
        "  - How programmers prepare their environment of working (e.g., IDEs, Environments)\n",
        "  - What common concepts or patterns of thinking programmers use (e.g., data types, conditions, loops, functions, objects, classes, coding styles)\n",
        "2. **Build operational connection to communities of developers**:\n",
        "  - Know how to navigate to the right material for references;\n",
        "  - Know how to get help by searching the right keywords;\n",
        "  - Know how to ask the right questions in the right manner at the right place when references and searching do not help;\n",
        "3. **Gain on-hand experience and master general skills to know**:\n",
        "  - How to program freely with the standard libraries.\n",
        "  - How to learn how to use any third-party libraries.\n",
        "  - How to design and code for their topic of projects for later phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Audience Assumptions\n",
        "  - General curiosity to programming.\n",
        "  - High school level of skills in material reading , instructions following, logical thinking, and written expressions.\n",

        "### Forms of Instruction\n",
        "1. **Self-Paced Individual Learning**  (Including around 15 minutes of videos in total and other reading materials.)\n",
        "  - **Mode of Instruction**: Learn through consuming independently a series of provided material (in both videos and readings/tutorials).\n",
        "  - **Features**: Tailored for self-driven, visual-oriented, or previously experienced learners, as well as those who need to catch up misses sections or review.\n",
        "2. **Interactive Learning (Choose One of Two)** (Once a week) (One hour)\n",
        "- **Option I: Structured Lecturing**\n",
        "  - **Mode of Instruction**: In more traditional approach, lecture along the arranged contents, and make sure all participants have mastered all the expected skills.\n",
        "  - **Features**: Tailored for less self-driven, or interaction-oriented learners, expecting no efforts paid in advance to the previous self-paced individual learning.\n",
        "  - **Required Commitment**: On time and complete participance.\n",
        "- **Option II: Unstructured Lecturing**\n",
        "  - **Mode of Instruction**: In more responsive approach, collect and answers questions that are commonly met during the self-paced individual learning processes,  guide students in more unstructured and interactive ways, and make sure all students have mastered all the expected skills.\n",
        "  - **Features**: Tailored for somewhat self-driven or prefer not to attend traditional forms of lectures.\n",
        "  - **Required Commitment**: Exhibited mastery of all the expected skills.\n",
        "3. **Coding Sessions** (Three Times a week) (One hour each, Three hours in total)\n",
        "  - **Mode of Instruction**: \n",
        "      - Semi-structured gathering on Discord (either Voice or Text) as learners code freely on assignments or projects and ask instructors questions whenever they feel necessary.\n",
        "      - Relatively more structured discussions on GitHub where learners and instructors take part in solving more personalized questions.\n",
        "  - **Features**: Tailored for learners who love group learning experience. \n",
        "  - **Required Commitment**: Optional but encouraged attendance.\n",
        "  - **Note**: Instructors of these sessions will make sure that all discussions posted before the session time are sufficiently answered by the end of the session each week.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Seminars** (Once a week, one hour in total)\n",
        "  - **Mode of Instruction**: \n",
        "      - **Guest Speakers**: Structured lectures provided by selected speakers.\n",
        "      - **Group Discussion** :  Somewhat moderated group discussions.\n",
        "  - **Required Commitment**: On time and complete participance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prepare For Phase 1\n",
        "- Join the discord channel: Chat, talk ,and discuss before and during the program\n",
        "  - Use this link to join CCIR Techcamp @ Discord: https://discord.gg/kPeKzMBVtD\n",
        "- Create a GitHub account: We will use GitHub for storing our repositories.\n",
        "  - Our GitHub Organization Page: https://github.com/CCIR-Academy\n",
        "    - You will be invited to the organization and to collaborate on team repositories.\n",
        "- Create a Google Account: We will use Colab for an online learning experience with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "  - All course Jupyter notebooks would include a link to opening at Google Colab.\n",
        "- Environment and devices configured for smooth online video meeting experience.\n",
        "  - We will use Zoom as our main video conference software."
