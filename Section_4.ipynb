        "- Python as the \"glue language\": Python has been popular in many different areas in which many excellent third party packages or wrappers (i.e., wrapping/translating packages that allow you to incorporate features from packages natively written in other languages by using certain common interfaces) have been developed and distributed. With distribution systems like pypi, users can start developing more abstract projects directly instead of \"building the wheels again\".\n"
